          <p> For this project, I collected data for over a year on every mass shooting that happened in the U.S. between 2014 and 2019. I had read the same story, over and over, after every high-profile mass shooting that had occurred over the past few years -- that the perpetrator's past had been littered with domestic violence-related red flags, that he'd abused his ex-partners, stalked them, written manifestos about how all women deserved to die. I was curious about how many perpetrators of the smaller-scale mass shootings that didn't receive as much media attention, if any at all, fit similar profiles.  
        </br></p>

        <p> I was responsible for the reporting, data analysis, design, and graphics of this story. </p>
